    MOAR BREAKTHROUGHS PLZ


    --- opposite of earthquakes ---
    |
    |   Big earthquakes happen if there haven't been any small earthquakes recently.
    |   Big breakthroughs happen after many small refactorings.
    |
    -------------------------------

                THEREFORE: lots of small refactorings toward a more explicit model

                  1. cements everyone's thinking about the model
                  2. keeps the model up-to-date with reality
                  3. keeps the code supple and easy to change





                ALSO: Talk about the model with experts. As much as possible.
                      (Do the monthly pack!)

                ALSO: Read / learn firsthand about the domain model. As much as possible.
                      (Anyone know any good blogs?)


                The goal is to sniff out implicit concepts and make them explicit.
